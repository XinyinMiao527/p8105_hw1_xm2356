```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Problem 1

The dataset has `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```


## Problem 2

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
