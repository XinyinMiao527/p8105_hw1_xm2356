data("early_january_weather")
```

## Scatterplot

``` r
p_temp_time <- ggplot(early_january_weather,
                      aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Temperature vs Time (colored by humidity)",
       x = "time_hour",
       y = "Temperature",
       color = "humid") +
  theme_minimal()

p_temp_time
```
